# Home_Sales
Module 22
I used Google Collab to complete this assignment. The finished notebook is saved under Home_Sales.ipynb

In order to read in the CSV I had to download the CSV file locally using wget, I then read the locally downloaded CSV file into a DataFrame.
I then created a temporary view of the dataframe and ran a simple query to make sure I was able to run my queries.
